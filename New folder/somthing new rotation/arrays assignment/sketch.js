// Array assignment, making a game tetris 

// game plan 1...

// plan to make tetris where i need to...
// make a randomizer that brings in random different (pre made?) shapes... 
// make the shapes collide with a specific window width / window height... 
// and also make the shapes collide with other shapes that were previosly placed...
// make the shapes movable with (W,A,S,D or arrow keys) and rotatable...

// game plan 2...

// have the same idea of tetris but you have to stack boxes on top of eachother and see how far you can reach up...
// boxes will become smaller with each 5 boxes placed beforehand...
//
